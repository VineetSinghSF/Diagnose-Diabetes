# Diagnose-Diabetes
Diabetes Classification using Machine Learning
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to diagnose diabetes based on medical records of patients. The goal is to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on certain medical features. We employ a Random Forest Classifier and evaluate the model's performance using common classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix heatmap.

Project Overview
Dataset: The project uses a dataset containing medical records of patients, with features such as Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, and Outcome (whether or not the patient is diabetic).

Model: The Random Forest Classifier is used to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not.

Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances.

Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.

Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix: A visual representation of the classification performance, showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to diagnose diabetes from patient data. By using the Random Forest Classifier and evaluating its performance with key metrics, this approach can help in building a system to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diabetes more accurately.
